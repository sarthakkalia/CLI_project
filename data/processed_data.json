PS1 is\n       set and $- includes i if bash is interactive,  allowing  a\n       shell script or a startup file to test this state.\n\n       The  following  paragraphs  describe how bash executes its\n       startup files.  If any of the files exist  but  cannot  be\n       read,  bash reports an error.  Tildes are expanded in file\n       names as described below  under  Tilde  Expansion  in  the\n       EXPANSION section.\n\n       When  bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as\n       a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it  first\n       reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if\n       that file exists.  After reading that file, it  looks  for\n       ~/.bash_profile,  ~/.bash_login,  and  ~/.profile, in that\n       order, and reads and executes commands from the first  one\n       that  exists  and is readable.  The --noprofile option may\n       be used when the shell is started to inhibit  this  behav\u00ad\n       ior.\n\n       When a login shell exits, bash reads and executes commands\n       from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.\n\n       When an interactive shell that is not  a  login  shell  is\n       started,  bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc,\n       if that file exists.  This may be inhibited by  using  the\n       --norc  option.   The --rcfile file option will force bash\n       to  read  and  execute  commands  from  file  instead   of\n       ~/.bashrc.\n\n       When  bash  is  started  non-interactively, to run a shell\n       script, for example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in\n       the  environment,  expands  its value if it appears there,\n       and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to  read\n       and  execute.   Bash  behaves  as if the following command\n       were executed:\n              if [ -n \"$BASH_ENV\" ]; then . \"$BASH_ENV\"; fi\n       but the value of the PATH variable is not used  to  search\n       for the file name."

Ingress and IngressClass types in the `extensions/v1beta1` and `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API versions are deprecated and will no longer be served in 1.22+. Persisted objects can be accessed via the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API. Notable changes in v1 Ingress objects (v1beta1 field names are unchanged):\n* `spec.backend` -> `spec.defaultBackend`\n* `serviceName` -> `service.name`\n* `servicePort` -> `service.port.name` (for string values)\n* `servicePort` -> `service.port.number` (for numeric values)\n* `pathType` no longer has a default value in v1; \"Exact\", \"Prefix\", or \"ImplementationSpecific\" must be specified\nOther Ingress API updates:\n* backends can now be resource or service backends\n* `path` is no longer required to be a valid regular expression"
